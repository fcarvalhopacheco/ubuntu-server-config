# Xubuntu 20.04 Initial Server Setup 

-----------------------------------------------------

##  Step 1: Enable and Disable Root User accounts

* As a new Ubuntu user, you may wonder how to log in to your Ubuntu system as a root user or what is the default root password. In Ubuntu Linux, the root user account is disabled by default for security reasons

1. Grant sudo acesss to another user

    1. On your xubuntu machine terminal, type:
    
    ```sh
    usermod -aG sudo addthenameofusername
    ```

2. Enable Root User Account

    ```sh
    sudo passwd root
    ```

    > Enter and confirm the new root password

## Step 2. Set up SSK keys

1. Create the RSA Key Pair

    1. On the client machine (personal computer, not the server), type 
    
    ```sh
    ssh-keygen                   # By default ssh-keygen will create a 2048-bit RSA key pair, which is secure enough for most use cases (you may optionally pass in the -b 4096 flag to create a larger 4096-bit key).
    ```

    ```sh 
    # Output
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/your_home/.ssh/id_rsa):
    
    ```
    
    2. Just Press enter or create your own name key, such as /your_home/.ssh/id_rsa_xubuntu_server 

    ```sh
    # Output
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    
    # Out out will be something like
    Your identification has been saved in /your_home/.ssh/id_rsa_xubuntu_server.
    Your public key has been saved in /your_home/.ssh/id_rsa.pub_xubuntu_server.
    The key fingerprint is:
    a9:49:2e:2a:5e:33:3e:a9:de:4e:77:11:58:b6:90:26 username@remote_host
    The key's randomart image is:
    +--[ RSA 2048]----+
    |     ..o         |
    |   E o= .        |
    |    o. o         |
    |        ..       |
    |      ..S        |
    |     o o.        |
    |   =o.+.         |
    |. =++..          |
    |o=++.            |
    +-----------------+
    ```
    > You now have a public and private key that you can use to authenticate. The next step is to place the public key on your server so that you can use SSH-key-based authentication to log in.

2. Copy the Public Key to the Xubuntu 20.04 Server.

    1. On your client machine terminal, type:
    
    ```sh
    ssh-copy-id username@ipaddress_of_your_server
    
    # Output
    The authenticity of host '203.0.113.1 (203.0.113.1)' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is fd:fd:d4:f9:77:fe:73:84:e1:55:00:ad:d6:6d:22:fe.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    
    ```
    > Type the password for your remote server and press ENTER.
    > This will connect to your remote host using the password, then will copy the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub key into a file in the remote accounts'home ~/.ssh directory called authorized_keys.


3. Test the new key

    ```sh
    ssh username@ipaddress_of_your server
    ```
    
    * If ssh is still asking for password, try the following

    1. On your server, type:
    
    ```sh
    sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    # Activate the following
    PubkeyAuthentication yes
    ```
    
    2. Also, try to specify the ssh-key you generated

    ```sh
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@ipaddress_of you_server
    ```

## Step 3 Disable Password Authentication on XUBUNTU server

* If you were able to login to your account using SSH without a password, you have successfully configured SSH key-based authentication to your account. However, your password-based authentication mechanism is still active, meaning that your server is still exposed to brute-force attacks.

1. Open and modify the sshd_config file

    ```sh
    sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    # Inside the file, find and modify the following 
    ...
    PasswordAuthentication no
    ...
   
    # Save and close
    :wq
    ```

2. Apply the changes

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl restart ssh
    ```
