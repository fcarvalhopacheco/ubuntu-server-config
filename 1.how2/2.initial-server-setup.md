# Xubuntu 20.04 Initial Server Setup 

------------------------------------------------------

##  Step 1: Enable and Disable Root User accounts
* As a new Ubuntu user, you may wonder how to log in to your Ubuntu system as a root user or what is the default root password. In Ubuntu Linux, the root user account is disabled by default for security reasons

1. Grant sudo acesss to another user

    ```sh
    # On your xubuntu machine terminal, type:
    usermod -aG sudo addthenameofusername
    ```

2. Enable Root User Account

    ```sh
    sudo passwd root
    ```
> Enter and confirm the new root password


## Step 2. Set up SSK keys

1. Create the RSA Key Pair

    ```sh
    # On the client machine (personal computer, not the server), type 
    ssh-keygen
    ```
> By default ssh-keygen will create a 2048-bit RSA key pair, which is secure enough for most use cases (you may optionally pass in the -b 4096 flag to create a larger 4096-bit key).

    ```sh 
    # Output
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/your_home/.ssh/id_rsa):
    ```
> Press enter 

    ```sh
    # Output
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    ```
> enter your own passphare to create addtional layer of security


    ```sh
    #Out out will be something like
    Your identification has been saved in /your_home/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /your_home/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    a9:49:2e:2a:5e:33:3e:a9:de:4e:77:11:58:b6:90:26 username@remote_host
    The key's randomart image is:
    +--[ RSA 2048]----+
    |     ..o         |
    |   E o= .        |
    |    o. o         |
    |        ..       |
    |      ..S        |
    |     o o.        |
    |   =o.+.         |
    |. =++..          |
    |o=++.            |
    +-----------------+
    ```
> You now have a public and private key that you can use to authenticate. The next step is to place the public key on your server so that you can use SSH-key-based authentication to log in.

2. Copy the Public Key to the Xubuntu 20.04 Server.

    ```sh
    # on your client machine terminal, type:
    ssh-copy-id username@ipaddress_of_your_server
    ```
> you may see the following:
    
    ```sh
    Output
    The authenticity of host '203.0.113.1 (203.0.113.1)' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is fd:fd:d4:f9:77:fe:73:84:e1:55:00:ad:d6:6d:22:fe.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    ```
> Type the password for your remote server and press ENTER.
> This will connect to your remote host using the password, then will copy the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub key into a file in the remote accounts'home ~/.ssh directory called authorized_keys.


3. Test the new key

    ```sh
    ssh username@ipaddress_of_your server
    ```
> If ssh is still asking for password, try the following

    ```sh
    # on your server
    sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    # Activate the following
    PubkeyAuthentication yes
    ```
> Also, try to specify the ssh-key you generated

    ```sh
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@ipaddress_of you_server
    ```
