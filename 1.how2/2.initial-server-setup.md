# Xubuntu 20.04 Initial Server Setup 

-----------------------------------------------------

##  Step 1 - Enable and Disable Root User accounts

* As a new Ubuntu user, you may wonder how to log in to your Ubuntu system as a root user or what is the default root password. In Ubuntu Linux, the root user account is disabled by default for security reasons

1. Grant sudo acesss to another user

    1. On your xubuntu machine terminal, type:
    
    ```sh
    usermod -aG sudo addthenameofusername
    ```

2. Enable Root User Account

    ```sh
    sudo passwd root
    ```

    > Enter and confirm the new root password

## Step 2 - Set up SSK keys

1. Create the RSA Key Pair

    1. On the client machine (personal computer, not the server), type 
    
    ```sh
    ssh-keygen                   # By default ssh-keygen will create a 2048-bit RSA key pair, which is secure enough for most use cases (you may optionally pass in the -b 4096 flag to create a larger 4096-bit key).
    ```

    ```sh 
    # Output
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/your_home/.ssh/id_rsa):
    
    ```
    
    2. Just Press enter or create your own name key, such as /your_home/.ssh/id_rsa_xubuntu_server 

    ```sh
    # Output
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    
    # Out out will be something like
    Your identification has been saved in /your_home/.ssh/id_rsa_xubuntu_server.
    Your public key has been saved in /your_home/.ssh/id_rsa.pub_xubuntu_server.
    The key fingerprint is:
    a9:49:2e:2a:5e:33:3e:a9:de:4e:77:11:58:b6:90:26 username@remote_host
    The key's randomart image is:
    +--[ RSA 2048]----+
    |     ..o         |
    |   E o= .        |
    |    o. o         |
    |        ..       |
    |      ..S        |
    |     o o.        |
    |   =o.+.         |
    |. =++..          |
    |o=++.            |
    +-----------------+
    ```
    > You now have a public and private key that you can use to authenticate. The next step is to place the public key on your server so that you can use SSH-key-based authentication to log in.

2. Copy the Public Key to the Xubuntu 20.04 Server.

    1. On your client machine terminal, type:
    
    ```sh
    ssh-copy-id username@ipaddress_of_your_server
    
    # Output
    The authenticity of host '203.0.113.1 (203.0.113.1)' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is fd:fd:d4:f9:77:fe:73:84:e1:55:00:ad:d6:6d:22:fe.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    
    ```
    > Type the password for your remote server and press ENTER.
    > This will connect to your remote host using the password, then will copy the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub key into a file in the remote accounts'home ~/.ssh directory called authorized_keys.


3. Test the new key

    ```sh
    ssh username@ipaddress_of_your server
    ```
    
    * If ssh is still asking for password, try the following

    1. On your server, type:
    
    ```sh
    sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    # Activate the following
    PubkeyAuthentication yes
    ```
    
    2. Also, try to specify the ssh-key you generated

    ```sh
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@ipaddress_of you_server
    ```

## Step 3 - Disable Password Authentication on XUBUNTU server

* If you were able to login to your account using SSH without a password, you have successfully configured SSH key-based authentication to your account. However, your password-based authentication mechanism is still active, meaning that your server is still exposed to brute-force attacks.

1. Open and modify the sshd_config file

    ```sh
    sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    # Inside the file, find and modify the following 
    ...
    PasswordAuthentication no
    ...
   
    # Save and close
    :wq
    ```

2. Apply the changes

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl restart ssh
    ```

## Step 4 - Change the Default SSH port

1. Change the default ssh port on your server.

    ```sh
    sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    # Activate #Port 22 and change to a number between 1024 and 65535
    ...
    Port 2522       # 2552 just for this example
    ...

    # Save and close
    :wq
    ```
2. Restart the ssh service.
    
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl restart sshd
    ```

3. Allow traffic on the new port by changing the firewall

    ```
    sudo ufw allow 2552/tcp
    ```

## Step 5 - Configure IDLE timeout interval

* The idle timeout interval is the amount of time an SSH connection can remain active without any activity. Such idle sessions are also a security risk. It is a good idea to configure idle timeout interval.

1. Open, edit, modify and save the sshd_config file
   
    ```sh
    sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    
    # Activate and change the line
    ClientAliveInterval 300

    # save and exit
    :wq

    # Restart sshd
    sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```

## Step 6 - Allow SSH access to selected users only

1. Open as sudo the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file :

    ```sh
    # Add the following:
    AllowUsers  <username>              # change <username> with whatever you want
    ````
2. Disable root access for safety

    ```sh
    # on the same file, add the following:
    PermitRootLogin no

    # Restart service
    service sshd restart
    ```

## Step 7 - Install and configure Fail2ban

* This tool is used to scan the authlog and if it finds a certain amount of failed login attempts from an IP, it will proceed to add that IP to /etc/hosts.deny or iptables/netfilter in order to lock out the attacker for a few minutes.

1. Install Fail2ban
    
    ```sh
    # On your server, type the following 
    sudo apt install fail2ban
    ```

2. Copy your configuration files to a backup

    ```sh
    sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.conf /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.local
    sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
    ```

3. Enable Fail2Ban on your server and check all running jails

    ```sh
    systemctl start fail2ban
    systemctl enable fail2ban
    ```

4. Check the status
    
    ```sh
    fail2ban-client status
    ```

5. How to whitelist IP in Fail2Ban

* If you want to permanently whitelist the IP, you should edit the jail configuration file. Go to the said jail section and add the ignoreip line like this:

    ```sh
    ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 <IP_TO_BE_WHITELISTED>
    ```
* If you want to whitelist an IP from all the jails on your system, it would be a better idea to edit the /etc/fail2ban/jail.local file and add a line under the DEFAULT section like what we saw above.

Youâ€™ll have to restart Fail2Ban to take this change into effect.

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
    ```

6. Check the status of the ignored ips.
    
    ```sh
    sudo fail2ban-client set sshd addignoreip
    These IP addresses/networks are ignored:
    |- 127.0.0.0/8
    |- ::1
    `- xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx    ---> your ip
    ```

7. Set up an email support to check activities

    ```sh
    # Install
    sudo apt-get install sendmail
    
    # Edit your /etc/fail2ban/jail.local file
    action = %(action_mw)s

    # You can also change the sending and receiving email addresses:
    destemail = admin@linuxize.com
    sender = root@linuxize.com
    ```

8. Change bantime.

    ```sh
    # edit your jail.local file
    bantime =1d
    ```
