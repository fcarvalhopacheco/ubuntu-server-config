# Ubuntu 20.04  - Fixing the WIFI 

> The  Ubuntu 20.04 server installation software does not include wireless network support packages, so it relies on the user to enable the Wi-Fi connection.
> I didn't have ethernet connection either. 

------------------------------------------------------

##  Step 1: Download WPA Supplicant Package and Its Dependecies 

> Since the server has no wired ethernet connection, you need to download the WPA supplicant package (wpasupplicant) and two of its dependencies (libnl-route-3–200, libpcsclite1) on another machine with an internet connection, then transfer them to the server using a flash/external drive.
